Chrome Tampermonkey Scripts

## dark-light-toggle
When using dark mode on Mac, chrome will set all pages to dark which is great, except that we want some sites remain white e.g. Wechat Official Account Articals(mp.weixin.com).
The (origin version of this plugin)[https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/396483-%E4%B8%BB%E9%A2%98%E5%88%87%E6%8D%A2] is dev by **taumu**.
I've viewed the code to make sure there's no malicious actions and modified some code to better fit my need. (removed unsafeWindow, change '浅色主体' to 'light mode' etc.)
